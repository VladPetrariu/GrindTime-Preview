# GrindTime-Preview
**Preview of GrindTime**, a productivity focused social app build with SwiftUI.
This repo showcases the timer engine and photo capture workflow used in the full GrindTime app. In this README I will also describe what GrindTime is in more detail and provide screen shots of the current working version of the app.

## Overview 🌎
GrindTime is an iOS mobile app designed to track studying to make it feel more interactive, competitive and rewarding. 
Users track focused work sessions by capturing start and end photos, tracking time spend working on each session and visualizing progress over time.

This preview includes only the UI and interaction logic for the timer and camera flow.
All other functionality, backend logic, session storage and proprietary features remain private.
